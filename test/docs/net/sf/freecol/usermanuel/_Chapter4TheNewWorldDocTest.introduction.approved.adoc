= Introduction

At the beginning of the game, you will start with 1 `Vessel` and 2 `Colonists`.
Your first task will be to discover the New World, which should lie due West, although sailing North West or South West may prove quicker.
As soon as you have discovered land, you can establish your colonies and produce goods to send home to Europe.
